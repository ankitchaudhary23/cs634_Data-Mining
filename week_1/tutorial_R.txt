#Set Working Directory

setwd("the directory of your files")
e.g.
setwd("c:/mydata/")


#Loading the data

mydata<-read.csv("Games.csv")

mydata <- read.table("Games.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")



#Install packages

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

#Using help
??ggplot2


#nba sports data in 2016

#"." - data file in current directory

summary(mydata)


#Exploring the data

#show the first 5 lines of data under the attribute names

head(mydata, n = 5) #@ symbol is used to refer to all attributes in the data frame

#Dimension of the data file
dim(mydata)
nrow(mydata)
ncol(mydata)

#Access data by row/col
mydata[1:2, 1:3]

#Mean
mean(mydata$X1st.score) #$ symbol is used to refer to specific attribute


#R provides a wide range of functions for obtaining summary statistics. One way to get descriptive statistics is to use the sapply( ) function with a specified summary statistic. Below is how to get the mean with the sapply( ) function:

sapply(mydata$X1st.score, mean, na.rm=TRUE)


#Possible functions used in sapply include mean, sd, var, min, max, median, range, and quantile.

#select rows from attribute slot of lnd_sport object, where sports participation is less than 20%.
mydata[mydata$X1st.score < 25, ]


#present the data
#Plot the all the scores of the first quarter and the second quarter
plot(mydata$X1st.score,mydata$X2nd.score)

#plot Regression of 1st quarter score on 2nd quarter score
abline(lm(mydata$X1st.score~mydata$X2nd.score))


#put the title on your plot
title("Regression of 1st quarter score on 2nd quarter score")


#show the box plot of scores
boxplot(mydata[,2:5],main = 'the box plot of scores')



# show the correlation between two columns
cor(mydata[,2],mydata[,3])



#Saving as R data
save(mydata, file = "mydata.RData")

#Loding R data
load("mydata.RData")

#Print some sentence on the screen
cat("Hello World!")
